BUGS:
  IE:
    - brand shifts slightly on mouseover
    - responsive layout does not work
      - should work in IE9 but previous versions of IE are incompatible with responsive Bootstrap
    - columns on "About Us" page do not work
      - known issue: IE is incompatible with CSS 'column-count' attribute
    - Bootstrap is incompatible with IE6
      - current fix: error box appears, requesting that users upgrade to a newer version of IE
  Safari:
    - columns on "About Us" page carry over margins strangely
      - known issue: Safari does not handle CSS 'column-count' attribute correctly
  Opera:
    - on drop-down menus, the top link is only partially highlighted on mouseover (should be fully highlighted)
      - the break in highlighting occurs where the navbar is separated from the rest of the page
        - might be related to the CSS positioning ('relative', 'absolute', 'z-index', etc.)
  Non-browser-specific:
    - FlexSlider causes whitespace to appear on right side of page when mouse is not over the slider
      - current fix: CSS 'body { overflow: hidden; }' disables it from being visible
        - side-effect: disables horizontal scrollbar (this shouldn't matter except that IE isn't resizing itself so the page cannot be viewed in smaller windows)

TO DO:
  - Centre dropdown menus
  - Replace current text with correct text
    - banner
    - home page content
  - Replace images with better versions
    - all current images are low-quality, badly cropped copies from the .psd
  - Create other content pages
  - Link pages together (all links currently go nowhere)
  - Check that mobile version of the site works
